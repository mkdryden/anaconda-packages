# Glib's GIO notification subsystem recently got a piece that causes it to
# require OS X 10.9 or later. This is a stricter requirement than I'd like,
# and it seems unlikely to be used in scientific situations, so I've patched
# it out. Note that we can only do this because Glib's OS X version check is
# broken and doesn't detect our -mmacosx-version-min setting.
